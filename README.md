# EXP 5: Comparative Analysis of Na√Øve Prompting versus Basic Prompting Using ChatGPT Across Various Test Scenarios
---

## AIM  
To investigate how the structure and clarity of prompts (**na√Øve vs. basic**) affect ChatGPT‚Äôs performance across diverse task categories (creative writing, Q&A, summarization, etc.). The experiment measures variations in:  
- **Response quality** (clarity, coherence),  
- **Accuracy** (factual correctness),  
- **Depth** (detail, contextual understanding),  
and establishes guidelines for crafting effective AI prompts.  

---

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Prompt Classification  
- **Na√Øve Prompt:** Unstructured, vague, lacks specificity (e.g., *"Tell me a story"*).  
- **Basic Prompt:** Well-defined, includes **context, objectives, and constraints** (e.g., *"Write a 150-word bedtime story for a 5-year-old about a rabbit who learns to share."*).  

### 2.2 Task Categories  
Five scenarios tested with paired prompts:  
1. **Creative Writing**  
2. **Factual Q&A**  
3. **Summarization**  
4. **Advice/Recommendation**  
5. **Code Explanation**  

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics  
| Metric       | Description                                 |  
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Quality**  | Clarity, coherence, grammatical correctness |  
| **Accuracy** | Factual correctness, relevance              |  
| **Depth**    | Detail, contextual understanding            |
